When you type the letter "g" on your keyboard, your web browser will receive the event and trigger the auto-complete functions. The suggestions presented to you in the dropdown below the URL bar will vary depending on your browser's algorithm and whether you are in private/incognito mode or not. These algorithms typically sort and prioritize suggestions based on factors such as your search history, bookmarks, cookies, and popular searches from the internet as a whole. As you continue typing "google.com", multiple blocks of code will execute and refine the suggestions with each keypress. In fact, the auto-complete function may even suggest "google.com" before you finish typing it.
